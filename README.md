A production-ready **Flutter Web + iOS + Android** starter tailored for migrating an HTML/CSS site that pulls content from **Contentful**.

This repo gives you:

- Contentful integration (GraphQL-first, REST fallback)
- Routing (`go_router`)
- Theming (light/dark + brand colors)
- Responsive UI scaffolding (web ↔ mobile)
- HTML-to-Widget rendering for Contentful rich text
- Caching (Hive) + simple offline mode
- ENV management with `flutter_dotenv`
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions) for build & deploy
- Web deploy recipes (Firebase Hosting **or** Cloudflare Pages)

> Copy the file tree below into a Flutter project (`flutter create aatmkala_flutter`), then replace placeholders in `.env`.
